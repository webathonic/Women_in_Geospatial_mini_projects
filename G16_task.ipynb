        "1)\tNumber guessing game: Write a Python code that asks a number from the user and compare it to a number you saved in memory. If the number added by the user is lower than the hidden number, print Too low, else print Too high and if correct, print Yay!\n",
        "2)\tEven or Odd number: Ask the user for a number and print whether it is even or odd.\n",
        "3)\tMini calculator: Ask for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and print the result. Handle division by zero to appear as an error in a message like this: Division by 0 is impossible.\n",
        "4)\tWords counter: Ask the user to enter a sentence and count: total characters and total words. If a user types I am grateful, your code should do: This contains 13 characters and 3 words.\n",
        "5)\tGrade printer: Ask a user for a score and print grade: 90-100 → A, 80-89 → B, 70-79 → C, 50-69 → D, and 0-49 → E\n",
        "6)\tTemperature converter: Ask the user for an input of temperature in Celsius and convert it into Fahrenheit and vice versa. You can ask the user to choose the unit first. Depending on the user’s choice, you can do the conversion and print a message on the screen.\n",
        "7)\tTemperature Analysis: Given a list of daily temperatures (you can define your list with random numbers), count how many days were above 35°C. If more than 3 days, print: Heatwave alert.\n",
        "8)\tWeather category classifier: Ask the user for temperature and print a message following the conditions: < 20 → Cold, 20-30 → Moderate > 30 → Hot\n",
        "9)\tSea level rise projections: Assume sea level rises 3 mm per year. Ask the user how many years into the future. Calculate and print the total sea level rise according to the number of years specified.\n",
        "10)\tSolar Energy estimator: Assume that 1 solar panel produces 1.5 kWh per day. Ask a user how many panels he/she has. Calculate and print to the screen: Daily energy and Monthly energy."
